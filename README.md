## Installation
1. Download ``application.xml`` and ``StandaloneLoader.swf`` in <a href="//github.com/bjuonday/otgithub/releases/tag/app">Releases page</a>
2. Right click 'OldTanks Online' icon, click over 'Open file location' button
3. Drag the file onto a folder from installed application, for example:
- For application.xml: ``C:\Games\OldTanks Online\META-INF\AIR\``

#### Just incase, if you want to recover ``application.xml`` file:
