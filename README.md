2. Right click 'OldTanks Online' icon, click over 'Open file location' button
3. Drag the file onto a folder from installed application, for example:
- For delete_cache.bat: ``C:\Users\[Your username]\Desktop``
- For application.xml: ``C:\Games\OldTanks Online\META-INF\AIR\``
- For StandaloneLoader.swf: ``C:\Games\OldTanks Online\``

### If your cache has not been cleaned yet:
1. Run ``delete_cache.bat`` and press any key to quit, if done successfully

#### Just incase, if you want to recover ``application.xml`` file:
1. Copy and paste old ``application.xml`` file
2. If you replaced with the new file but the old one remains, delete the replaced file and rename the old one with the one it used to
